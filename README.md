# Makerspace Lockout Project
 
Makerspace  staff  exert  much  of  their  time watching over students and verifying safety training...  a  process  that  is  mundane, imperfect, and begs for automation.Our  motivation  was  to  non-obtrusively enforce  the  safe  and  sustainable  use  of machinery  in  the  Makerspaces  across campus through RF student ID verification against a user database - if a student is not trained, power is cut to the tool and it will not turn on.
