# CAD

There are three 3D-printable parts for the housing shown below, which was designed by BryanPatrick (baf56@pitt.edu).
- The body, which is a hollowed container with an exposed front meant to house the ESP8266 arduino and wiring. A slot is cutout on the top to allow removal of the pressfit lid (see below) and on the side to allow a power cord to reach the arduino.
- The lid, which is a pressfit cap for the hollow body. It has a slot for a neopixel and RFID reader to pressfit into. It also has slots for the U shape holder to pressfit into (see below)
- The U shape holder, which is meant to hold a student ID at the perfect height so that the embedded RFID element is aligned with the RFID sensor when seated in the holder. The bottom is open to allow sawdust or other particulate to fall right through.

Unfortunately, I cannot find the body part file. Perhaps BP still has it.
